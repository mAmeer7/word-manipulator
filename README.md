////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
Function of this App.

This app generally takes the input and covert it all to upper case, it also counts the words and charcater.

*The framework used is react and bootstrap5

Learnings while building>

1. How to create components and import them.

2. Relationships between src, public, build, node modules folder.

3. Concept of States and props.

4. React Routers, and general <Router> was letting my pages malfunction while deploying, so I used <HashRouter>. Its not recommended to use HashRouter everytime but if needed. And last thing the react-router-dom version is v6 so probably you won't see Switch.
